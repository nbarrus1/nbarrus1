### Background
 
I am a PhD candidate at Florida International University where I study the fresh water communities of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem.  I did my undergrad at the University of Wyoming where I studied food webs in the Wyoming Research Scholars Program. My project was identifying suitable baseline proxies to better compare trophic positions and food webs across sites along the longitudinal gradient of the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains ecotone. I did a masters in Florida Atlantic University where I studied population dynamics of the Florida apple snail, a species of conservation concern.  I currently live in Plantation FL with my wife and children.
